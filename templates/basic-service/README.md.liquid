## Overview

This is a JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) service for Polkadot. JAM services have four entry points:

- **refine**: Stateless computation (up to 6 seconds PVM execution, handles up to 15 MB input, produces max 90 KB output)
- **accumulate**: Stateful integration into chain state (~10ms execution time)
- **on_transfer**: Inter-service communication
- **is_authorized**: Work item validation

## Building

### Prerequisites

1. Install Rust nightly:
   ```bash
   rustup install nightly
   rustup default nightly
   ```

2. Add the RISC-V target:
   ```bash
   rustup target add riscv32ema-unknown-none-elf
   ```

3. Install polkatool (when available):
   ```bash
   cargo install polkatool
   ```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the JAM service using cargo-jam
cargo jam build --release

# Or build manually:
cargo +nightly build --release --target riscv32ema-unknown-none-elf \
    -Z build-std=core,alloc \
    -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort

# Link into a .jam blob (when polkatool is available):
polkatool jam-service target/riscv32ema-unknown-none-elf/release/{{ project_name | snake_case }} -o {{ project_name }}.jam
```

## Deployment

The build produces a `.jam` blob that can be deployed to the JAM chain.

## JAM Service Entry Points

### Refine

The `refine` function is the primary processing workhorse. It performs stateless computation that transforms work items into work results. Key characteristics:

- Runs off-chain
- Up to 6 seconds PVM execution time
- Accepts up to 15 MB of input data
- Produces up to 90 KB of output
- Can perform preimage lookups

### Accumulate

The `accumulate` function integrates work results into the chain state. It is stateful and can:

- Read storage from any service
- Write to its own key-value store
- Transfer funds between services
- Create new services
- Upgrade its own code

### OnTransfer

The `on_transfer` function handles inter-service communication asynchronously. Messages and tokens are sent between services and processed within the same 6-second execution period.

### IsAuthorized

The `is_authorized` function validates whether a work item should be processed before it enters the refine stage.
